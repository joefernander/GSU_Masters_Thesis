            Driven by higher education’s challenges in maintaining student motivation and achievement during the recent pandemic-induced shift to online learning, we investigate the effectiveness of text messages as a nudging tool to increase academic performance. To do so, we use a nonplacebo randomized controlled trial in which the treatment group directly receives SMS texts that review lecture content and give deadline reminders, while the control group only has access to the same information on the course page. Our findings suggest that the reception of motivating SMS messages per se, rather than the content review, has a positive effect on examination outcomes.},

However, knowing who to nudge, how to nudge or when to nudge can be a challenge. Providing students with strategic, sensitive nudges that help to move them forward is almost an art form. It requires not only technical skills to use appropriate software and interpret data, but careful consideration of what to say and how to say it.

              Participation in educational activities is an important prerequisite for academic success, yet often proves to be particularly challenging in digital settings. Therefore, this study set out to increase participation in an online proctored formative statistics exam by digital nudging. We exploited targeted nudges based on the Fogg Behaviour Model, highlighting the relevance of acknowledging differences in motivation and ability in allocating nudges to elicit target behaviour. First, we assessed whether pre‐existing levels of motivation and perceived ability to participate are effective in identifying different propensities of responsiveness to plain untailored nudges. Next, we evaluated whether tailoring nudges to students' motivation and perceived ability levels increases target behaviour by means of a randomized field experiment in which 579 first‐year university students received 6 consecutive emails over the course of three weeks to nudge behaviour regarding successful participation in the online exam. First, the results point out that motivation explains differences in engagement as indicated by student responsiveness and participation, whereas the perceived ability to participate does not. Second, the results from the randomized field experiment indicate that tailored nudging did not improve observed engagement. Implications for the potential of providing motivational information to improve participation in online educational activities are discussed, as are alternatives for capturing perceived ability more effectively.

                    Students' internal barriers to online participation and persistence in higher education are lack of motivation and perceived ability.
                  
                  
                    Nudging interventions tackle students' behavioural barriers, and are particularly effective when guided by a theory of behaviour change, and when targeting students who suffer most from those barriers.

                    This study examines whether students with different levels of motivation and perceived ability vary in their online behaviour in response to nudges.
                  
                  
                    This study experimentally evaluates whether targeted nudges—targeted at students' motivation and perceived ability—are more effective than plain (not‐targeted) nudges.

                    The results indicate the importance of motivation for performing nudged behaviours regarding successful participation in an online educational activity.
                  
                  
                    The results do not provide evidence for the role of perceived digital ability, yet do show prior performance on a similar educational activity can effectively distinguish between students' responsiveness.

          This study examined the opportunities and difficulties of online learning in Zambia's higher education system, emphasizing the effects of self-regulation as a mediator between student participation in the classroom and online interactions that teachers guide. Students and teachers frequently encounter significant challenges, such as low motivation, engagement, and self-regulation, despite the growing popularity of online learning. Data was gathered from an online survey of 1323 undergraduate students who took online courses in blended learning environments at four higher education institutions in Zambia. The results show a substantial mediating effect of self-regulation between student learning engagement and teacher-scaffolded online interactions. Findings underscore the need for comprehensive strategies to enhance online learning experiences, including constructive feedback, conducive learning environments, and continuous professional development programs for teachers. Further, it highlights the importance of activities to improve students’ learning management skills and promote self-discipline in online learning. It highlights the vital role of self-regulation, active learning engagement, and teacher-scaffolded online interactions in online learning. It calls on school administrators to develop innovative ways to make participating in online learning more smoothly.},

A systematic review was conducted to explore help-seeking strategies in online learning environments. A search on help-seeking strategies in online environments in Educational Research Information Center (ERIC) and PsycInfo yielded 36 peer-reviewed articles that met the inclusion criteria for this study. Karabenick and Knapp’s categories of help-seeking (formal help-seeking, informal help-seeking, instrumental activities, lowering performance aspirations, and altering goals) were used to review the strategies employed by students in online learning. The results show that there is an extreme lack of research on learners’ psychological decision-making process when they lower performance aspirations or alter their goals. Moreover, most studies focus on the learners’ formal and informal help-seeking behaviors in online settings. Since much research has been limited to small case studies that are not always generalizable, future studies are encouraged to include more instructional contexts and personal variables like gender, age, educational background, and mastery of computer skills. To avoid biases that may occur in self-reporting studies, recommendations are made for future studies that use more subjective methods to trace their actual help-seeking behaviors.},

Initial attempts to measure self-regulated learning (SRL) using questionnaires and interviews were successful in demonstrating significant predictions of students’ academic outcomes. The present article describes the second wave of research, which has involved the development of online measures of self-regulatory processes and motivational feelings or beliefs regarding learning in authentic contexts. These innovative methods include computer traces, think-aloud protocols, diaries of studying, direct observation, and microanalyses. Although still in the formative stage of development, these online measures are providing valuable new information regarding the causal impact of SRL processes as well as raising new questions for future study.},

For example, there are questions about whether students engage with courses as educators intend and what features of online courses engage students to enhance learning. Bringing together student and educator perspectives, this article reports on a study that identified ‘pedagogical touchpoints’ – opportunities within online courses for student engagement – to ascertain whether a better understanding of these could improve online course design and student engagement. Data were collected across three undergraduate online courses. Data analysis produced three key findings: mapping pedagogical touchpoints against dimensions of engagement reveals patterns that may inform enhanced course design, students’ engagement with pedagogical touchpoints varies according to their learning needs and desires, and mapping pedagogical touchpoints can inform course design at both conceptual and practical levels. Discussion of the findings highlights that purposeful design of online courses, including strategic planning for pedagogical touchpoints, can maximise the potential for student engagement and consequent learning.},

This article describes the development and implementation of a web-based, fully integrated early alert referral system at a large, public university in the Southwest. After a brief review of the academic early alert concept, the article describes the development of the system from a conceptual perspective, including how administrative, faculty, and student service input guided development. The next section details the technical aspects of system design, presented from the end-user perspective, emphasizing the integration of the system into the campus student information system. The following section includes a thorough description of the first term's experience implementing the system, including aggregated descriptive data for those using the system, the students referred, and the follow-up to the referrals. Initial analysis indicates a modest positive relationship between personal follow-up to referral and student success. The article concludes with recommendations for research and practice.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to answer the following questions: On which early alert system suggestions are students more likely to act? What factors drive students’ decisions to act on early alert system recommendations?
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This study examined whether students’ behaviour changed after receiving the results of an early alert system (CDR). In the middle of a semester, 423 students with varying levels of English proficiency were invited to try the CDR and complete a questionnaire that asked about their perception of the tool and whether they planned to act on the recommendations they received.
            
            
              Findings
              Results suggested that students mainly planned to take the assessment-related recommendations provided through the CDR to improve their assessment performance. Results also suggested that student anxiety and student ability affected the likelihood that students would act on the recommendations.
            
            
              Practical implications
              These findings provide useful insights for early alert system designers to establish a system that generates useful recommendations for students.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The findings of this study contribute to the development of early alert systems. Designers can now realise what suggestions can be effectively offered to students.},

Course learning analytics data (CLAD), combined with nudging initiatives, have emerged as strategies for engaging online students. This paper presents a mixed method case study involving a staged intervention strategy focussing on the employment of timely, strategic communication interventions conducted across 19 courses and six disciplines. The research methodology utilised CLAD, online surveys, student interviews and student evaluations of teaching. The findings substantiate benefits for both academics and students. Academics benefitted from the provision of a relatively simple, accessible and proactive intervention for increasing students’ capacities to be more in control and engaged in their learning. Students benefitted as the intervention accentuated critical resources to assist them to better address assessment requirements, align their expectations more realistically with those of the course, and more readily demonstrate their learning obligations and responsibilities.},

We assigned 2539 first-year undergraduate and graduate students in China to either a nudging group, which received course information augmented with behavioral cues (including framing effects and social norms), or a control group, which received only basic course information. Outcomes measured included self-reported willingness to enroll, willingness to recommend enrollment, and actual enrollment actions. Results indicated that students in the nudging group demonstrated significantly higher engagement levels than those in the control group across all metrics.

Utilizing a qualitative, single-case study design, we conducted interviews with 12 students who participated in an intrusive advising program at a large, urban community college in Texas. Analysis of the interview data revealed the benefits, limitations, and contributions to success of intrusive advising. This study addresses a notable gap in the extant literature, as few researchers have published empirical examinations on the impact of intrusive academic advising within the community college context. The findings can be used to improve the delivery of academic advising and student support services at community colleges.},

By analyzing data extracted from the learning management system at the end of week 5, the model can predict with an accuracy of 88\% whether the student will pass or fail a specific course. Data from the grade books from all course shells from the Spring 2022 semester (N = 22,041 rows) were analyzed, and four factors were found to be significant predictors of student success/failure: the current course grade after the fifth week of the semester and the presence of missing grades in weeks 3, 4, and 5. Several models were investigated before concluding that a neural network model had the best overall utility for the purpose of an early alert system. By categorizing students who are predicted to fail more than one course as being generally at risk, we provide a metric for those who use early warning systems to target resources to the most at-risk students and intervene before students drop out. Seventy-four percent of the students whom our model classified as being generally at risk ended up failing at least one course.},

	abstract = {This study explores the potential of ChatGPT as a virtual tutor to facilitate self-directed learning (SDL) among adult learners in asynchronous online contexts. Although SDL has been identified as a critical skill, factors such as the lack of skills to find resources and the absence of a supportive learning environment could impede adult learners’ ability to engage in SDL. By harnessing the power of AI, ChatGPT can assist adult learners in setting learning goals, locating available resources, designing personalized learning plans, monitoring their performance, and reflecting on their learning experiences, ultimately leading to the effective completion of SDL. This study also discusses several existing limitations and challenges, including the need for instructors to provide guidance on creating prompts to use ChatGPT effectively, the possibility of learners becoming reliant on ChatGPT, the significance of institutions to provide policies of proper use of ChatGPT, and the necessary for AI developers to continuously improve the algorithms and data used by the system to minimize the likelihood of providing incorrect and irrelevant information. Additionally, some questions are raised regarding the balance between the use of ChatGPT and engagement with human instructors to ensure optimal learning outcomes. This study aims to enlighten adult educators and practitioners towards the integration of ChatGPT in asynchronous online learning to facilitate adult learning.},

	abstract = {Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) are gaining popularity as a platform for providing students with insights into their learning behaviour patterns in online environments. Existing LAD studies are mainly centred on displaying students’ online behaviours with simplistic descriptive insights. Only a few studies have integrated predictive components, while none possess the ability to explain how the predictive models work and how they have arrived at specific conclusions for a given student. A further gap exists within existing LADs with respect to prescriptive analytics that generate data-driven feedback to students on how to adjust their learning behaviour. The LAD in this study attempts to address this gap and integrates a full spectrum of current analytics technologies for sense-making while anchoring them within theoretical educational frameworks. This study’s LAD (SensEnablr) was evaluated for its effectiveness in impacting learning in a student cohort at a tertiary institution. Our findings demonstrate that student engagement with learning technologies and course resources increased significantly immediately following interactions with the dashboard. Meanwhile, results showed that the dashboard boosted the respondents’ learning motivation levels and that the novel analytics insights drawn from predictive and prescriptive analytics were beneficial to their learning. This study, therefore, has implications for future research when investigating student outcomes and optimizing student learning using LAD technologies.},

              The purpose of this research study is to validate an instrument that measures the importance instructors and students place on online student engagement strategies.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The online student engagement strategies survey was completed by 160 faculty and 146 students. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and an exploratory factor analysis. The factor structure was examined using a principal component analysis with an oblique rotation.
            
            
              Findings
              Results show that the Online Engagement Strategies Questionnaire has a valid and reliable structure. Based on the exploratory factor analysis, four engagement constructs emerged including peer engagement, multimodal engagement, instructor engagement, and self-directed engagement. Results and discussion assist in identifying key engagement strategies within this online student engagement framework.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The validated instrument fills a gap in the literature, and it has value to practitioners, researchers, administrators and policy makers because it has practical applications.},

Learners in online learning environments need more self-regulation and especially more help-seeking strategies. A systematic review was conducted to explore help-seeking strategies in online learning environments. A search on help-seeking strategies in online environments in Educational Research Information Center (ERIC) and PsycInfo yielded 36 peer-reviewed articles that met the inclusion criteria for this study. Karabenick and Knapp’s categories of help-seeking (formal help-seeking, informal help-seeking, instrumental activities, lowering performance aspirations, and altering goals) were used to review the strategies employed by students in online learning. The results show that there is an extreme lack of research on learners’ psychological decision-making process when they lower performance aspirations or alter their goals. Moreover, most studies focus on the learners’ formal and informal help-seeking behaviors in online settings. Since much research has been limited to small case studies that are not always generalizable, future studies are encouraged to include more instructional contexts and personal variables like gender, age, educational background, and mastery of computer skills. To avoid biases that may occur in self-reporting studies, recommendations are made for future studies that use more subjective methods to trace their actual help-seeking behaviors.},
