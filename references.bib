	abstract = {Introduction
              In 2020, COVID-19 forced higher education institutions in many countries to turn to online distance learning. The trend of using online education has accelerated across the world. However, this change in the teaching mode has led to the decline of students' online learning quality and resulted in students being unable to do deep learning. Therefore, the current research, aimed at promoting deep learning in the online environment, constructed a theoretical model with learning self-efficacy and positive academic emotions as mediators, deep learning as the dependent variable, perceived TPACK support, peer support, technical usefulness, and ease of use as independent variables.
            
            
              Methods
              The theoretical model was verified by SPSS26.0 and smartPLS3.0, and to assess the measurement and structural models, the PLS approach to structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed.
            
            
              Results
              The study found that (a) positive academic emotions play a mediating role between perceived TPACK support and deep learning, perceived peer support and deep learning, and perceived technology usefulness and ease of use and deep learning; (b) learning self-efficacy plays a mediating role between perceived TPACK support and deep learning, perceived peer support and deep learning, and perceived technology usefulness and ease of use and deep learning.
            
            
              Discussion
              The findings of this study fill the gaps in the research on the theoretical models of deep learning in the online environment and provide a theoretical basis for online teaching, learning quality, and practical improvement strategies.},

In this study, the research hypotheses on the influences of the environmental perception of online learning (including students’ self-factors, teacher factors, peer factors, and technological factors) on individual cognitive engagement (deep engagement and superficial engagement) were proposed. The mediating effect of the influences of self-efficacy on individual cognitive engagement under the online learning model was estimated. Results demonstrate that the Cronbach’s α of the questionnaire used in the study is 0.891 and the KMO is 0.841. These outcomes reflect that this questionnaire has very good reliability and validity. In the online learning environment, students’ self-factors, peer factors, and technological factors can promote individual cognitive engagement significantly. Furthermore, self-efficacy develops a mediating effect in the significantly positive promotion of environmental perception on individual cognitive engagement. Cognitive engagement also changes with the duration of online learning (F=4.530, p=0.005). Moreover, the influences of majors on cognitive engagement are significant at the 0.05 level (F=2.188, p=0.047). Conclusions have important references to comprehend the influences of different environmental perception factors on individual cognitive engagement in the process of online learning and disclose how self-efficacy influences individual cognitive engagement.},

Whether this approach could be a practical way to raise school achievement on a large scale remains unknown. We therefore delivered brief growth-mind-set and sense-of-purpose interventions through online modules to 1,594 students in 13 geographically diverse high schools. Both interventions were intended to help students persist when they experienced academic difficulty; thus, both were predicted to be most beneficial for poorly performing students. This was the case. Among students at risk of dropping out of high school (one third of the sample), each intervention raised students’ semester grade point averages in core academic courses and increased the rate at which students performed satisfactorily in core courses by 6.4 percentage points. We discuss implications for the pipeline from theory to practice and for education reform.},

            Driven by higher education’s challenges in maintaining student motivation and achievement during the recent pandemic-induced shift to online learning, we investigate the effectiveness of text messages as a nudging tool to increase academic performance. To do so, we use a nonplacebo randomized controlled trial in which the treatment group directly receives SMS texts that review lecture content and give deadline reminders, while the control group only has access to the same information on the course page. Our findings suggest that the reception of motivating SMS messages per se, rather than the content review, has a positive effect on examination outcomes.},

              Participation in educational activities is an important prerequisite for academic success, yet often proves to be particularly challenging in digital settings. Therefore, this study set out to increase participation in an online proctored formative statistics exam by digital nudging. We exploited targeted nudges based on the Fogg Behaviour Model, highlighting the relevance of acknowledging differences in motivation and ability in allocating nudges to elicit target behaviour. First, we assessed whether pre‐existing levels of motivation and perceived ability to participate are effective in identifying different propensities of responsiveness to plain untailored nudges. Next, we evaluated whether tailoring nudges to students' motivation and perceived ability levels increases target behaviour by means of a randomized field experiment in which 579 first‐year university students received 6 consecutive emails over the course of three weeks to nudge behaviour regarding successful participation in the online exam. First, the results point out that motivation explains differences in engagement as indicated by student responsiveness and participation, whereas the perceived ability to participate does not. Second, the results from the randomized field experiment indicate that tailored nudging did not improve observed engagement. Implications for the potential of providing motivational information to improve participation in online educational activities are discussed, as are alternatives for capturing perceived ability more effectively.

                    Students' internal barriers to online participation and persistence in higher education are lack of motivation and perceived ability.
                  
                  
                    Nudging interventions tackle students' behavioural barriers, and are particularly effective when guided by a theory of behaviour change, and when targeting students who suffer most from those barriers.

                    This study examines whether the Fogg Behaviour Model is suited to guide a nudging intervention with the aim to increase student engagement in online higher education.
                  
                  
                    This study examines whether students with different levels of motivation and perceived ability vary in their online behaviour in response to nudges.
                  
                  
                    This study experimentally evaluates whether targeted nudges—targeted at students' motivation and perceived ability—are more effective than plain (not‐targeted) nudges.
                  
                
              
              
                Implications for practice and/or policy
                
                  
                    The results indicate the importance of motivation for performing nudged behaviours regarding successful participation in an online educational activity.
                  
                  
                    The results do not provide evidence for the role of perceived digital ability, yet do show prior performance on a similar educational activity can effectively distinguish between students' responsiveness.
                  
                  
                    Targeted nudges were not more effective than plain nudges, but the potential of other motivational nudges and how to increase perceived performance are discussed.},

          This study examined the opportunities and difficulties of online learning in Zambia's higher education system, emphasizing the effects of self-regulation as a mediator between student participation in the classroom and online interactions that teachers guide. Students and teachers frequently encounter significant challenges, such as low motivation, engagement, and self-regulation, despite the growing popularity of online learning. Data was gathered from an online survey of 1323 undergraduate students who took online courses in blended learning environments at four higher education institutions in Zambia. The results show a substantial mediating effect of self-regulation between student learning engagement and teacher-scaffolded online interactions. Findings underscore the need for comprehensive strategies to enhance online learning experiences, including constructive feedback, conducive learning environments, and continuous professional development programs for teachers. Further, it highlights the importance of activities to improve students’ learning management skills and promote self-discipline in online learning. It highlights the vital role of self-regulation, active learning engagement, and teacher-scaffolded online interactions in online learning. It calls on school administrators to develop innovative ways to make participating in online learning more smoothly.},

Learners in online learning environments need more self-regulation and especially more help-seeking strategies. A systematic review was conducted to explore help-seeking strategies in online learning environments. A search on help-seeking strategies in online environments in Educational Research Information Center (ERIC) and PsycInfo yielded 36 peer-reviewed articles that met the inclusion criteria for this study. Karabenick and Knapp’s categories of help-seeking (formal help-seeking, informal help-seeking, instrumental activities, lowering performance aspirations, and altering goals) were used to review the strategies employed by students in online learning. The results show that there is an extreme lack of research on learners’ psychological decision-making process when they lower performance aspirations or alter their goals. Moreover, most studies focus on the learners’ formal and informal help-seeking behaviors in online settings. Since much research has been limited to small case studies that are not always generalizable, future studies are encouraged to include more instructional contexts and personal variables like gender, age, educational background, and mastery of computer skills. To avoid biases that may occur in self-reporting studies, recommendations are made for future studies that use more subjective methods to trace their actual help-seeking behaviors.},

For example, there are questions about whether students engage with courses as educators intend and what features of online courses engage students to enhance learning. Bringing together student and educator perspectives, this article reports on a study that identified ‘pedagogical touchpoints’ – opportunities within online courses for student engagement – to ascertain whether a better understanding of these could improve online course design and student engagement. Data were collected across three undergraduate online courses. Data analysis produced three key findings: mapping pedagogical touchpoints against dimensions of engagement reveals patterns that may inform enhanced course design, students’ engagement with pedagogical touchpoints varies according to their learning needs and desires, and mapping pedagogical touchpoints can inform course design at both conceptual and practical levels. Discussion of the findings highlights that purposeful design of online courses, including strategic planning for pedagogical touchpoints, can maximise the potential for student engagement and consequent learning.},

This article describes the development and implementation of a web-based, fully integrated early alert referral system at a large, public university in the Southwest. After a brief review of the academic early alert concept, the article describes the development of the system from a conceptual perspective, including how administrative, faculty, and student service input guided development. The next section details the technical aspects of system design, presented from the end-user perspective, emphasizing the integration of the system into the campus student information system. The following section includes a thorough description of the first term's experience implementing the system, including aggregated descriptive data for those using the system, the students referred, and the follow-up to the referrals. Initial analysis indicates a modest positive relationship between personal follow-up to referral and student success. The article concludes with recommendations for research and practice.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to answer the following questions: On which early alert system suggestions are students more likely to act? What factors drive students’ decisions to act on early alert system recommendations?
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This study examined whether students’ behaviour changed after receiving the results of an early alert system (CDR). In the middle of a semester, 423 students with varying levels of English proficiency were invited to try the CDR and complete a questionnaire that asked about their perception of the tool and whether they planned to act on the recommendations they received.
            
            
              Findings
              Results suggested that students mainly planned to take the assessment-related recommendations provided through the CDR to improve their assessment performance. Results also suggested that student anxiety and student ability affected the likelihood that students would act on the recommendations.
            
            
              Practical implications
              These findings provide useful insights for early alert system designers to establish a system that generates useful recommendations for students.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The findings of this study contribute to the development of early alert systems. Designers can now realise what suggestions can be effectively offered to students.},

Course learning analytics data (CLAD), combined with nudging initiatives, have emerged as strategies for engaging online students. This paper presents a mixed method case study involving a staged intervention strategy focussing on the employment of timely, strategic communication interventions conducted across 19 courses and six disciplines. The research methodology utilised CLAD, online surveys, student interviews and student evaluations of teaching. The findings substantiate benefits for both academics and students. Academics benefitted from the provision of a relatively simple, accessible and proactive intervention for increasing students’ capacities to be more in control and engaged in their learning. Students benefitted as the intervention accentuated critical resources to assist them to better address assessment requirements, align their expectations more realistically with those of the course, and more readily demonstrate their learning obligations and responsibilities.},

We assigned 2539 first-year undergraduate and graduate students in China to either a nudging group, which received course information augmented with behavioral cues (including framing effects and social norms), or a control group, which received only basic course information. Outcomes measured included self-reported willingness to enroll, willingness to recommend enrollment, and actual enrollment actions. Results indicated that students in the nudging group demonstrated significantly higher engagement levels than those in the control group across all metrics. These findings suggest the potential of nudging strategies to effectively enhance college students’ participation in online mental health education.},

By analyzing data extracted from the learning management system at the end of week 5, the model can predict with an accuracy of 88\% whether the student will pass or fail a specific course. Data from the grade books from all course shells from the Spring 2022 semester (N = 22,041 rows) were analyzed, and four factors were found to be significant predictors of student success/failure: the current course grade after the fifth week of the semester and the presence of missing grades in weeks 3, 4, and 5. Several models were investigated before concluding that a neural network model had the best overall utility for the purpose of an early alert system. By categorizing students who are predicted to fail more than one course as being generally at risk, we provide a metric for those who use early warning systems to target resources to the most at-risk students and intervene before students drop out. Seventy-four percent of the students whom our model classified as being generally at risk ended up failing at least one course.},

By harnessing the power of AI, ChatGPT can assist adult learners in setting learning goals, locating available resources, designing personalized learning plans, monitoring their performance, and reflecting on their learning experiences, ultimately leading to the effective completion of SDL. This study also discusses several existing limitations and challenges, including the need for instructors to provide guidance on creating prompts to use ChatGPT effectively, the possibility of learners becoming reliant on ChatGPT, the significance of institutions to provide policies of proper use of ChatGPT, and the necessary for AI developers to continuously improve the algorithms and data used by the system to minimize the likelihood of providing incorrect and irrelevant information. Additionally, some questions are raised regarding the balance between the use of ChatGPT and engagement with human instructors to ensure optimal learning outcomes.

	abstract = {Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) are gaining popularity as a platform for providing students with insights into their learning behaviour patterns in online environments. Existing LAD studies are mainly centred on displaying students’ online behaviours with simplistic descriptive insights. Only a few studies have integrated predictive components, while none possess the ability to explain how the predictive models work and how they have arrived at specific conclusions for a given student. A further gap exists within existing LADs with respect to prescriptive analytics that generate data-driven feedback to students on how to adjust their learning behaviour. The LAD in this study attempts to address this gap and integrates a full spectrum of current analytics technologies for sense-making while anchoring them within theoretical educational frameworks. This study’s LAD (SensEnablr) was evaluated for its effectiveness in impacting learning in a student cohort at a tertiary institution. Our findings demonstrate that student engagement with learning technologies and course resources increased significantly immediately following interactions with the dashboard. Meanwhile, results showed that the dashboard boosted the respondents’ learning motivation levels and that the novel analytics insights drawn from predictive and prescriptive analytics were beneficial to their learning. This study, therefore, has implications for future research when investigating student outcomes and optimizing student learning using LAD technologies.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this research study is to validate an instrument that measures the importance instructors and students place on online student engagement strategies.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The online student engagement strategies survey was completed by 160 faculty and 146 students. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and an exploratory factor analysis. The factor structure was examined using a principal component analysis with an oblique rotation.
            
            
              Findings
              Results show that the Online Engagement Strategies Questionnaire has a valid and reliable structure. Based on the exploratory factor analysis, four engagement constructs emerged including peer engagement, multimodal engagement, instructor engagement, and self-directed engagement. Results and discussion assist in identifying key engagement strategies within this online student engagement framework.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The validated instrument fills a gap in the literature, and it has value to practitioners, researchers, administrators and policy makers because it has practical applications.},

Four of these are presented in this chapter, 1. LA as a concern or problem to be solved, 2. LA as an opportunity, 3. LA as field of inquiry and 4. the researchers and practitioners that make up the LA community. These four ways of understanding LA and its associated constructs, technologies, domains and history can hopefully provide a launch pad not only for the other chapters in this handbook but the world of LA in general. A world that, although large, is open to all who hold an interest in data and learning and the complexities that follow from the combination of the two.},

The study included 1,163 students at a distance education university in China. Two online questionnaires were used to determine online SRL strategies. GPA scores were obtained from the university exam database to determine academic performance. The analysis showed that there are great differences between different self-regulated strategies and between different students when accepting the online learning. The analysis also showed that self-evaluation, metacognitive self-regulation, and effort regulation were positive predictors of academic progress, besides, self-evaluation and effort regulation had mutual influence effect on the improvement of GPA in online learning. These data will help teachers, education policymakers, and education administrators adopt and implement online learning services to improve students' academic performance.},

College students (N=177) at a Southeastern U.S. university responded to the Online Self-Regulated Learning Questionnaire. Exploratory structural equation modeling revealed four self-regulation factors: goal setting, environment management, peer help-seeking, and task strategies. Latent profile analysis yielded four latent profiles: Below Average Self-Regulation (BASR), Average Self-Regulation (ASR), Above Average Self-Regulation (AASR), and Low Peer Help-Seeking (LPHS). Compared with the AASR group, when students anticipated obtaining a higher course grade, they were less likely to engage in peer helpseeking and task strategies and more likely to adopt the LPHS self-regulation profile. Relating to LPHS, membership to all other groups predicted significantly lower course grades. AASR and LPHS predicted their performance most accurately, with non-significant differences between the predicted and the final course grades.},

Past research has found a positive relationship between students’ computer self-efficacy and their satisfaction with online learning, but little research has explored how learning management system and online learning self-efficacy relate to perceptions of satisfaction and perceived usefulness of online classes. In addition to confidence, students must also implement and apply their learning skills in an online environment; thus self-regulation and time management as well as past online learning experience are additional factors that have been shown to be related to satisfaction with and usefulness of online learning. This study explores how students’ confidence regarding their ability to use online learning platforms, utilize self-regulation strategies, and their confidence in their ability to learn in online classes predict both their satisfaction with and perceived usefulness of online classes. Multiple regression analyses revealed that students’ confidence to learn online was the strongest positive predictor of satisfaction and usefulness of online classes. The results indicate that exploring students’ purpose and reasons for taking online classes, beyond a students’ skill set and learning strategies, are fruitful directions to pursue when assessing evaluations of online classes.},

To address those concerns, this study measured three essential constructs of online learning (self-regulated learning, perceived presences, and learning motivation) based on a national survey in China (N = 12,826) and employed structural equation modeling to investigate their intertwined relationship. The study results reveal that (1) college students’ academic achievement cannot effectively predict their self-regulated learning in an online learning context; (2) self-regulation can be further differentiated into general and task-specific strategies with a varying impact on three types of presences; (3) online learning motivation is best predicted by cognitive presence, followed by social presence and teaching presence; and (4) the path of task-specific self-regulated learning → cognitive presence → online learning motivation generates the largest positive compound effect. Implications for online teaching and learning practice are also discussed through the stakeholder perspectives of students, teachers, and platform developers.},

The outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in large numbers of courses being shifted online, thus providing a large-scale setting to collect new empirical evidence to shed light on the specific challenges that different learner subgroups struggle with in the authentic online learning environment and then to provide practical implications to improve the learning outcomes by promoting learners’ online self-regulation. Based on a survey of 64,949 participants enrolled at 39 universities in a metropolitan city of China during the pandemic, we developed the Undergraduate Online Self-regulated Learning Questionnaire (UOSL), tested the reliability and construct validity of the UOSL items, and then built regression models to estimate the associations between online self-regulation and mastery of eight skills across different subgroups in a diverse student body. Disadvantaged subgroups such as rural, first-generation college students reported significantly lower UOSL scores as well as lower skill mastery in online learning. After controlling self-regulation in the regression model, these gaps related to student demographics have shrunk substantially and some become statistically insignificant (e.g., the gender gap in online skill mastery). The findings highlight the critical role of the targeted interventions of self-regulation to promote equity and enhance quality in the online teaching design and learning support.},

	abstract = {As enrolments in online courses continue to increase, there is a need to understand how students can best apply self-regulated learning strategies to achieve academic success within the online environment. A search of relevant databases was conducted in December 2014 for studies published from 2004 to Dec 2014 examining SRL strategies as correlates of academic achievement in online higher education settings. From 12 studies, the strategies of time management, metacognition, effort regulation, and critical thinking were positively correlated with academic outcomes, whereas rehearsal, elaboration, and organisation had the least empirical support. Peer learning had a moderate positive effect, however its conﬁdence intervals crossed zero. Although the contributors to achievement in traditional face-to-face settings appear to generalise to on-line context, these effects appear weaker and suggest that (1) they may be less effective, and (2) that other, currently unexplored factors may be more important in on-line contexts.},

Data were collected from two samples of students. The ﬁrst sample of students took coursework using an online course format while a second sample of students took coursework delivered via a blended or hybrid course format. Cronbach alpha (α) and conﬁrmatory factor analyses were performed to assess the psychometric properties of the OSLQ across both samples of students. Results indicate the OSLQ is an acceptable measure of self-regulation in the online and blended learning environments.},

Courses and books on basic statistics rarely cover the topic from a data science perspective. The second edition of this practical guide-now including examples in Python as well as R-explains how to apply various statistical methods to data science, tells you how to avoid their misuse, and gives you advice on what's important and what's not. Many data scientists use statistical methods but lack a deeper statistical perspective. If you're familiar with the R or Python programming languages, and have had some exposure to statistics but want to learn more, this quick reference bridges the gap in an accessible, readable format. With this updated edition, you'll dive into: Exploratory data analysis Data and sampling distributions Statistical experiments and significance testing Regression and prediction Classification Statistical machine learning Unsupervised learning.--},

	abstract = {Adaptive help-seeking as a learning strategy can influence learners' learning outcomes. Learners in online learning environments need more self-regulation and especially more help-seeking strategies. A systematic review was conducted to explore help-seeking strategies in online learning environments. A search on help-seeking strategies in online environments in Educational Research Information Center (ERIC) and PsycInfo yielded 36 peer-reviewed articles that met the inclusion criteria for this study. Karabenick and Knapp’s categories of help-seeking (formal help-seeking, informal help-seeking, instrumental activities, lowering performance aspirations, and altering goals) were used to review the strategies employed by students in online learning. The results show that there is an extreme lack of research on learners’ psychological decision-making process when they lower performance aspirations or alter their goals. Moreover, most studies focus on the learners’ formal and informal help-seeking behaviors in online settings. Since much research has been limited to small case studies that are not always generalizable, future studies are encouraged to include more instructional contexts and personal variables like gender, age, educational background, and mastery of computer skills. To avoid biases that may occur in self-reporting studies, recommendations are made for future studies that use more subjective methods to trace their actual help-seeking behaviors.},
